# Creating a svish plugin is too easy
# You need to write a function svish_your_awesome_plugin_name

function svish_awesome
    # You can get svish to the rendering by creating a list of the following 
    # segment_awesome 'My awesome plugin with #time and #weather '
    # After processing the contents (you can replace placeholders with values, e.g. #time)
    # set body (string replace "#time" (date +HH:MM), $segment_awesome)
    # Return the contents to render it
  
    printf "Time (date +%H:%M)"
    # That's it
end

function svish_awesome_init --description "Optional if you don't have anything to initialize"
    # provide default in case the user does not define the segment in config file (must start with segment_)
    # set -g segment_awesome 'My awesome plugin with #time and #weather '
    # 
    # Provide a decoration (optional) or svish is provide a default decoration (must be ..._decorator)
    # decoration - start foreground background end
    # set -g segment_awesome_decoration î‚¶ white red î‚´
    # You can also define variable needed only for your plugin
    # Being a prompt, all plugins are released once the prompt is rendered, so no permanent values
    # set -g total_logged_in_time 0

end

function svish_awesome_cleanup --description "Options if you have plugin variables"
    # svish will automatically remove variables from config file
    # Remove plugin variables, so that they don't pollute fish session
    # set -e -g total_logged_in_time
end

# That's it... Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
